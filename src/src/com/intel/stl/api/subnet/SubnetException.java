 *  Archive Log:    Changed DatabaseException into an unchecked exception. Then change error handling in the Datamanager so that certain FMExceptions (checked exceptions) bubble up to the API layer. Higher layers can then decide how to handle those exceptions. Any other Hibernate/HSQLDb/DAO exceptions are signaled as a DatabaseException (unchecked) to layers above the Datamanager.
