 *  Archive Log:    Defines a page weight that can be assigned to a controller implementing the IContextAware interface. The main issue is that ProgressObservers used to use 100 as the base to calculate the progress of a context switch or a refresh; as this amount was divided up by sub ProgressObservers, the amounts to each observer would be rounded and precision would get lost, resulting in a non-accurate progress bar. The current implementation uses a MainframeController-defined property which is passed from the observers and subobservers to the controller with the exact amount being reported and a more exact progress value can be calculated from the total weight involved.
