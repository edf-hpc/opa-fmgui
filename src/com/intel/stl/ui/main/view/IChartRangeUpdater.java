 *  Archive Log:    Updates to make delta data and cumulative data in same unit.
 *  Archive Log:    For Port performance, the DataChartScaleGroupManager is already updating the unit based on upper value among received/transmitted delta data. Introduced UnitDescription as a wrapper class to grab the unit information to be passed to counter (error) section from chart section.
 *  Archive Log:    For Node performance, since we need to convert data for all the ports, the conversion is done in PerformanceTableSection. the units will be decided by the delta data, not the cumulative data because it's smaller. With this update, received delta/cumulative data will be in a same unit and transmitted delta/cumulative data will be in same unit. However, it is possible that received data and transmitted data can be in different units. The charts are in same unit because it goes down to a double precision but table section is all in integer, so, we don't necessarily want to make them always in a same unit for now.
