 *  Archive Log:    PR 129447 - Database size increases a lot over a short period of time. Added method to expose application settings in the settings.xml file to higher levels in the app

 *  Archive Log:    PR 128897 - STLAdapter worker thread is in a continuous loop, even when there are no requests to service. Second wave of changes: the application can be switched between the old adapter and the new; moved out several initialization pieces out of objects constructor to allow subnet initialization with a UI in place; improved generics definitions for FV commands.

 *  Archive Log:    PR 128897 - STLAdapter worker thread is in a continuous loop, even when there are no requests to service. A new FEAdapter is being added to handle requests through SubnetRequestDispatchers, which manage state for each connection to a subnet.

 *  Archive Log:    Revision 1.11  2015/04/08 15:16:19  fernande
 *  Archive Log:    Changes to allow for failover to work when the current (initial) FE is not available.
 *  Archive Log:
 *  Archive Log:    Revision 1.10  2015/03/16 17:33:34  fernande
 *  Archive Log:    STLConnection lifecycle support. STLConnections can now be reused and temporary connections are not cached and their socket is closed after they are logically closed. Changed SubnetDescription in support of failover to have a list of HostInfo objects instead of just info for one host.

 *  Archive Log:    Revision 1.9  2015/02/10 19:28:15  fernande
 *  Archive Log:    SubnetContext are now created after a successful connection is made to the Fabric Executive, otherwise a SubnetConnectionException is triggered. Also, waitForConnect has been postponed until the UI invokes SubnetContext.initialize (thru Context.initialize). This way the UI shows up faster and the UI progress bar reflects more closely the process.

 *  Archive Log:    support secure FE:
 *  Archive Log:    1) added secured STL Connection to communicate with FE
 *  Archive Log:    2) added cert assistant interface that supports certs conf, persistence and password prompt
 *  Archive Log:    3) added default cert assistant
 *  Archive Log:    4) improved Subnet conf to support secure FE
